# Book Of  Recipes
Project inspired by [JAVA BACKEND DEVELOPER COURSE by IntelliJ JetBrains](https://hyperskill.org/projects/180)

## About
An urge to cook something special is too hard to resist sometimes. But what if you lost the recipe? Or your beloved grandma is too busy to answer a call and remind you of your favorite cake recipe? Let's make a program that stores all recipes in one place. Create a multi-user web service with Spring Boot that allows storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting recipes.

### You can run my program with: mvn spring-boot:run

### Frameworks Deployed
- Java
- Spring Boot Starter, Spring Boot JPA, Spring Boot JDBC, Spring MVC, Spring Boot Security
- Gradle
- JPA/Hibernate
- H2/SQL
- IntelliJ (IDE)
